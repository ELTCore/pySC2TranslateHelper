Param/Value/4062231D=<c val="8000FF">The Alien Host requires 70+ Karma in order to play.<n/><n/><c val="FF0000">Early game tactics:</c><c val="FF0080"><n/>During the early game, your goal should be to release Aliens specimens while diverting suspicion. Killing animals in the zoo with your alien form will turn them into deadly Alien minions which can easily destroy the station security turrets if not dealt with.</c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000">Situational awareness:</c><c val="FF0080"><n/>Make use of your alien sense to spot lone humans and use your alien form and infest ability to turn them into alien spawns. A white eye above your character will inform you that you are in sight range of station cameras. Destroying cameras when out of their sight range is an easy way to get around station without being seen. Knowledge about the map, station upgrades and when to fight are paramount for Alien victory.</c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000">Evolution into end-game:</c><c val="FF0080"><n/>Optimize your evolution point gain by laying eggs while you are in alien form and infesting as many life support systems as possible to ensure you stay powerful throughout the game. Be sure to put your eggs in safe places as you lose evo points for losing them. Aliens cannot make use of gene mods but can exchange money for evo points. Some Alien forms do benefit from marine suit upgrades like hitpoints and armor bonuses. Evolving into tier two unlocks the ability to use eggs and to create viral larvas which can infest the station or the moon. Tier three unlocks the ability to build a drone, hatchery, and infest the gas in the vents. When evolving a third time (into tier four), you and your spawns will lose the ability to disguise yourself as a human and will no longer be able turn other humans into spawns when killed but you will get access to he strongest alien form powers and the last Alien evolution. </c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000">Infestation:</c><c val="FF0080"><n/>Once the Alien evolves once into a body alien it gains the ability to use its infest ability on life support modules, located in floor 1 to 6. Infesting these modules will grant the Alien evolution points aswell as increased evolution points for as long as the module stays infested. The infested module will continually spawn Alien minions and start to spread creep. These can only be cleared from infestation with the use of a portable autodoc or reactor purge, making the portable autodoc a mandatory unlock. Creep will slow down humans and allow Aliens to move faster. If not dealt with, infested floors on the station can be deadly to traverse by humans. </c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000">History:</c><c val="8000FF"><n/>An unknown Alien organism boarded your ship in the last Cosmic Storm and now seeks to replicate itself among your insides. Now what? Well if this damned station had followed protocal in the first place none of this woul be happening. Anyways "unknown" is a little wonky since we have done tests on these types of minions, but they were heavily sedated. Obviously survival is at stake, and the more infested this station becomes the more deadly the Alien is. You'll want to keep the lights on and the Station Security updated.</c>

Always carry enough survival items, purchased at various shops and try to find a balance between unlocking upgrades for the crew and upgrading your marine suit and combat abilities. Knowledge is power! Learn to navigate on the map, memorize the vents layout, pay attention to the numbers for each floor, and the bonuses the crew and aliens can gain with station upgrades. There are many many many ways to kill and be killed. Be mindful of the negative alerts that are given from the station. <n/><n/><c val="8080FF">Upgrading:</c><n/>Weapons bench on level 5 will give you options to enhance your weaponry.<n/>Through the armory on level 6 you can unlock Sensor Detector (Hotkey "G") and Flashlight (Hotkey "F"). The flashlight is useful to spot hidden objects such as remote mines, burrowed aliens and increase vision range in the dark. <n/><n/><c val="8080FF">Radiation:</c><n/>When radiation modules are destroyed, you will slowly lose health and can die if left unattended. You can repair both modules in vents.<n/><n/><c val="8080FF">Oxygen:</c><n/>When your Oxygen is running out, be sure to grab a oxygen tank at a medical supplies shop and  turn oxygen back on in the reactor sub-level.<n/><n/><c val="8080FF">Power:</c><n/>When the power is out and security is low level, alien has a big advantage. You may need to repair the core, and will need to activate the two power nodes in the reactor sub-level<n/><c val="8080FF"><n/>Summary:</c><n/>Your goal as the human is to work together with others to ensure victory. To do so you will need to learn who to trust and spot suspicious activity. Do your job and pay attention to others doing or not doing their jobs for their role. Increasing station security systems, protecting the Captain, dealing with infestation and repairing destroyed security modules are key tasks the crew has to fulfill to ensure victory over the alien. </c>

These systems can be upgraded on various floors on the station. Most upgrades grant the crew additional bonuses if the corresponding crewmember purchases them. If the corresponding role is absent, another crewmember can purchase them, but the crew will lose out on bonuses. The Chief Intelligence Officer is a unique role in the sense that he always unlocks bonuses when researching upgrades, making him the 2nd most valuable role after Captain. The Alien may want to research station upgrades aswell as it allows for special bonuses that aid the aliens in various ways and hinder humans.<n/><n/><c val="8080FF">Station Security systems:</c><n/><c val="39AFE8">The station has many security turrets and cameras which will have to be brought online at the start oft he game. Once active, turrets will automatically attack Alien lifeforms and anyone targeted by station security. Whoever has access to the Captain's Card has control over the station security turrets. It is in the crew's best interest to defend their captain to prevent the Aliens from gaining control over the station security systems. Increasing station security level will increase the potency of station turrets aswell as sight range of cameras. With sufficient upgrades, they can function without power. The station security systems of floors 1 to 6 will be shut down if the corresponding security module, located in the vents, is destroyed and not function until repaired. Look out for Aliens destroying your security modules!</c>

You do not know who the other 2 Syndicate members are yet, so randomly killing and attacking people may be more harmful then beneficial. Try to remember where your stash is ASAP, and make sure its in a hidden location so others do not destroy your stash early on. Your stash grants you access to plenty of unique Syndicate based items as well as normal items.</c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000">Prelude to Chaos:</c><c val="80000"><n/>Understanding what your Syndicate Sub-role is is important as you want to play around that role in order to achieve your goal. Attempt to gain access to a Syndicate Communication Relay (SCR) in order to open up a new channel to communicate with the other members. Be careful, if you die you risk compromising the item. Stack up on items that you will need, but do not arouse suspicion.</c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000"></c><c val="FF0000">Operation - Fallen Station: </c><c val="80000"><n/>When your Crew is ready and parts of the Station are sabotaged to your use, the entire group should cause as much chaos, deception and death as possible. Work together to achieve your goals and eliminate the crew, either by going loud or through stealth and deceit. Utilize your unique roles in order to play to the best of your ability.</c><n/><n/><c val="FF0000">History:</c><c val="FF5959"><n/>The history of the Syndicate is that they are a Galactic Crime Organization that has its origins from Earth. They are responsible for 90% of the drug trade in the Alpha, Beta, and Charlie sectors of space. Many who are part of this mysterious organization are known to have great wealth and are very skillfull. The Syndicate also deals with manufacturing goods and controlling people and places who have done the Syndicate wrong. If you come into contact with the Syndicate, you or someone you know on the station has done something terribly wrong to get these people to target you or your crew. </c>
